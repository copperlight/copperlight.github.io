My name is [Matthew Johnson](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mjjohnson33) and I am currently a Sr. DevOps Engineer at [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/); I have been working in the DevOps space since I joined [Blackboard](http://www.blackboard.com/) in 2004.  The purpose of this site is to share notes and neat ways of solving problems.

If you have questions or comments on this site, file a GitHub issue and discussion will take place there.
