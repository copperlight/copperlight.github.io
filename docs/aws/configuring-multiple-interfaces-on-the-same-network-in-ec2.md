# Configuring Multiple Interfaces on the Same Network in EC2

<small>2014-07-09</small>

I've been reading a bit lately on Linux policy and source-based routing for the purpose of
configuring multiple NICs on the same network in EC2.  I found the following links helpful:

* [Multiple IPs and ENIs on EC2 in a VPC](http://blog.bluemalkin.net/multiple-ips-and-enis-on-ec2-in-a-vpc/)
* [Routing for Multiple Uplinks/Providers](http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html)
* [A Quick Introduction to Linux Policy Routing](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/05/29/a-quick-introduction-to-linux-policy-routing/)
