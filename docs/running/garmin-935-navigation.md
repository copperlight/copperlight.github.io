## Introduction

Out in the SF Bay Area, there are tons of trails which are fantastic for running. The
[Trailstompers] site is an excellent guide, covering six distinct regions split into four
difficulty levels. Descriptions of the trails, with some turn navigation advice and GPX
tracks are provided for each of the trails. The tracks can be imported into Garmin watches
and you can use the Navigation feature to help stay on course. There are two issues with
using these tracks directly on the watch:

* When loading a GPX track for navigation, it takes awhile to process the course on the watch
and it ends up having far too many points, throwing out many thousands of them.
* Garmin will make some guesses about what turn-by-turn navigation hints to display, but the
ones that you get end up being either obvious or they do not occur when you need them.

This page is a guide to a track processing process which allows you to add custom turn-by-turn
waypoints to tracks and post-processes them so that they appear correctly on your Garmin watch.

## Process

* Find a trail you like on [Trailstompers] and download the GPX track.
* Upload the GPX track to [GPSies].
* Edit the track and then modify the track.
* You can add a cue sheet, which will populate turn-by-turn hints on the track.
* Add or delete waypoints, as desired. It is best to keep waypoints for forks in the trail.
* Export the track as a TCX file.
* Download CourseTCX2Fit conversion tool from [@CTCX2Fit].
* Convert the file
* Connect your Garmin via USB.
* Access the Garmin storage device and copy the fit file to the X directory.
