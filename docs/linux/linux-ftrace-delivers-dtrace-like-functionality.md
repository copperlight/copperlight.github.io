<small>2014-07-22</small>

[Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/) recently released
[perf-tools](https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools), which is a collection of low-level
performance observability scripts akin to the [DTraceToolkit](http://www.brendangregg.com/dtracetoolkit.html).

He has a [new article](http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/608497/432e3e891beb761e/) posted on the tools at LWN.
